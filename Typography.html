<h1>Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift</h1>


<p id="Paragraph">
	<u><b>History</b></u>
	<br>
	Playwrite Deutschland Grundshrift (or Grundschrift for short) is a form of handwritting made in Germany. It was designed as an alternative approach to the three different curvise styles that were currently taught in schools at the time. These three were Lateinische Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schlausgangsschrift (SAS). These forms were mainly curvise styles of handwritting. However during the Kultusminister Konferenz, (Ministry of Culture conference), held in October 2020, it was decided to adopt a single cursive writing style for instruction. To support Schulausgangsschrift (SAS), education specialists have created a petition called Siegener Erklärung in reaction to this ruling. The style of hand writing that they eventualy voted for, was Grundschrift.</p>

<p>Grundschrift was a combination of existing handwritting styles. Sütterlinschrift, made by Ludwig Sütterlin, and Grotesk-Schrift made by Rudolf von Larisch and Fritz Kuhlmann. Sütterlin's Sütterlinschrift, was a strictly cursive style made with upright letters and rounder shapes. As opposed to Larisch's and Kuhlmann's Grotesk-Schrift, which was s simple handwritten print script.</p>
